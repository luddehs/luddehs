# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ludvig

I'm an aspiring Fullstack Developer with a diverse background in media and tech. My curiosity and drive for continuous learning have led me to web development. I love the challenge of crafting both functional and visually compelling solutions through code.

With experience in post-production, I've built a strong technical foundation and the ability to think creatively when solving problems. Working in agile environments has given me valuable insights into creating scalable, user-friendly solutions, and I bring that same mindset to my development work.

Recently, I completed a course in Fullstack Web Development, which gave me hands-on experience with both frontend and backend technologies. The course introduced me to a wide range of languages and frameworks, helping me gain a well-rounded perspective on the fullstack workflow.

Iâ€™m excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute to projects that enhance people's daily lives through thoughtful design.
